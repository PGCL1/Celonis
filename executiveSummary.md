# Executive Summary

This project began with an analysis of a business travel dataset with the primary objective of calculating the carbon emissions associated with business trips and deriving actionable insights. The approach leveraged Climatiq's travel API, which offered two distinct methods for emission calculation: a distance-based method and a spend-based method. Each method required its own set of request parameters to extract accurate emissions information.<br>

To achieve these goals, I first conducted an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to assess the distribution of variables, identify missing values, and detect any outliers within the dataset. I then prepared the dataset for API calls by creating necessary columns, removing duplicate records to minimize redundant API calls, and formatting the API response data appropriately. I followed a similar process for both the distance-based and spend-based methods, ensuring that each method’s unique requirements were met.<br>

Once the enriched dataset was prepared, I moved into the correlation and pattern analysis phase. Through this analysis, I discovered that five specific departments were responsible for the majority of the business’s greenhouse gas emissions. I generated visualizations and graphs to illustrate these trends and highlight the areas where emission reduction efforts could be most effective.<br>

Finally, based on the findings, I proposed a feasible solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which was based on reducing the amount of car trips in favor of rail travels. I believe my analysis could be part of larger effort to reduce GHG emissions for businesses as this data is readily available in all businesses. The target customer for this analysis hence would be any business wanting to reduce their scope 3 emissions. This type of a study, in my opinion, could propel a business into achieving its goal of net-zero carbon emissions.<br>
