# Celonis Case Study

This is my take on Celonis' case study for the Product Sustainability Intern position. I would like to thank Celonis for the opportunity as well as the Product team for their support. I had a lot of fun and wrote an executive summary to better illustrate my train of thought and findings.<br>[click here for more information](https://github.com/PGCL1/Celonis/blob/main/executiveSummary.md)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PGCL1/Celonis

python3 -m venv myenv

# active your virtual environment

# create a .env file and input the API_KEY
echo "API_KEY=\"<your-api-key>\"" > .env
```
